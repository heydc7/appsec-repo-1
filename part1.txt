Part 1: Setting up Your Environment

Actions:
1. Installed Git and configured user settings for signing commits.
2. Cloned the assignment repository from GitHub Classroom.
3. Set up SSH key to authentication & signing commits
4. Set up GitHub Actions to automatically build and test code.
5. Created and pushed a tag for submission.

Files:
1. .github/workflows/hello.yml

Description:
1. Installed & set up Git: 
Downloaded and installed Git using my local package manager to enable version control for the assignment repository.

2. Set up SSH key access to the GitHub account: 
Generated an SSH key pair and added the public key to my GitHub account to facilitate secure and password-less authentication for Git operations.

3. Configured Git user settings to sign commits using SSH: 
Executed the command `git config --global gpg.format ssh` to configure Git to use SSH for signing commits, ensuring code integrity and security.

4. Set up GitHub Actions for printing "Hello World": 
Created a continuous integration workflow to automatically trigger a simple job that prints "Hello World" each time a new commit is pushed to the repository.

5. Created a .github/workflows/hello.yml file: 
Defined the workflow in a YAML file to specify the actions to be taken during the GitHub Actions process, including the environment and command to run.

6. Verified that the action was running correctly in the GitHub interface: 
Checked the GitHub repository's Actions tab to confirm that the workflow executed successfully without errors upon each commit.

7. Submitted this part of the assignment by tagging my progress: 
Used Git tagging commands to mark my completion of Part 1, allowing for easy reference and submission of my work.
